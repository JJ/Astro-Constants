;[Git::Check]
; this is starting to wind me up, I gotta take Astro/Constants.pm out of git or something
;[@Git]		
; i don't know if that's supposed to be handled by PruneCruft, but 
; i use Git::GatherDir and add /{{$dist->name}}-* to my .gitignore 
;you can only use GatherDir or Git::GatherDir though, not both (@Basic includes the former)
